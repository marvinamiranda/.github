# Bootstrap the delivery standard (DELIVERY §14) for the marvinamiranda organisation.
#
# FIRST, ONCE, straight after this repository's own pull request merges into
# its test, and before any product repository moves its pin to that commit:
#   governance/bootstrap.sh --self-only                   # dry run
#   governance/bootstrap.sh --self-only --probe --apply   # this repository's rulesets
# Until then marvinamiranda/.github, whose code every other repository's
# required checks run, has no ruleset: "on test" means only "pushed".
#
# THEN, FOR EACH PRODUCT REPOSITORY, in this order, and only AFTER its adoption
# pull request has merged into its test: every step reads that repository's
# .github/governance/ from test (a dry run can read an unmerged one with
# --config-dir). Each run from a merged commit (below):
#   governance/bootstrap.sh --repo omni237 --repo omni237-ops                                # 1. dry run
#   governance/bootstrap.sh --repo omni237 --repo omni237-ops --no-rulesets --apply          # 2. default branch, labels
#   governance/bootstrap.sh --repo omni237 --repo omni237-ops --probe --no-rulesets --apply  # 3. Reviewer App probe
#   4. one Agent App squash-merge into test: under the rulesets a passing pull
#      request is the only way in, and the Agent App merges agents' ones.
#      Proven: marvinamiranda/omni237-ops#160 was squash-merged into test by
#      app/marvinamiranda-agent (commit 2be0641, 2026-09-25 17:52 UTC).
#   governance/bootstrap.sh --repo omni237 --repo omni237-ops --apply                        # 5. rulesets, owner only
# Without --no-rulesets, step 3 would also apply the rulesets in the same run.
#
# RUN IT FROM A MERGED COMMIT: check this repository out by the SHA of a commit
# on its test branch (`git checkout <sha>`). --apply refuses anything else: a
# commit that is not on test as GitHub has it now (read from
# https://github.com/marvinamiranda/.github.git, never from `origin`), a
# checkout with uncommitted changes, or files outside a git checkout. It
# prints the commit it runs from.
#
# DRY RUN BY DEFAULT: only read calls are made, and every call that would
# change something is printed instead. `--apply` executes them. Idempotent:
# each step reads the current state first and changes only what differs.
#
# THE CREDENTIAL FOR --apply: a fine-grained personal access token of the
# owner's, expiring the next day, passed as GH_TOKEN for that run only. Never
# add admin:org to the gh keyring login: agents on this machine can reach that
# login (DELIVERY §9), admin:org can disable the rulesets, and a scope removed
# again with `gh auth refresh --remove-scopes` stays on the token already
# issued (cli/cli#9233). Create it at github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens:
#   Resource owner: marvinamiranda. Expiration: custom, the next day.
#   Repository access: marvinamiranda/.github and each --repo (or all).
#   Organization permissions:
#     Issue Types: read and write      a) Epic, Decision, Spike
#     Projects: read and write         f) only with --project
#   Repository permissions:
#     Administration: read and write   b) the default branch; e) rulesets
#     Contents: read                   each repository's .github/governance/ and test
#     Issues: read and write           c) labels
#     Metadata: read                   always included: repositories, ruleset lists
#   d) the probe needs none of these: it posts with the Reviewer App's own token.
#   --self-only needs Administration and Metadata on marvinamiranda/.github alone.
# The organisation may have to approve the token first (its settings, Personal
# access tokens). Pass it without leaving it in the shell history:
#   read -rs GH_TOKEN && export GH_TOKEN       # paste it; nothing is echoed
#   governance/bootstrap.sh ... --apply
#   unset GH_TOKEN
# GitHub reports no permissions for a fine-grained token, so none is checked in
# advance: a step that lacks one fails, and nothing after it runs.
#
# Product structure lives in each product repository, never here (DELIVERY §6):
# it reads .github/governance/{areas.txt, required-checks.txt,
# required-checks.main.txt} from each repo's `test` branch, or from
# --config-dir <dir>/<repo>/ for local testing.
#
# What it does, in order:
#   a) org issue types Epic, Decision, Spike (Task and Bug must already exist;
#      Feature is left alone)
#   b) per repo: default branch -> test (closing keywords only act on merges
#      into the default branch, DELIVERY §4)
#   c) per repo: the §11 labels, plus area:* labels from areas.txt
#   d) with --probe: the Reviewer App posts a neutral review/independent check
#      on each repo's test head, proving it can post there before a ruleset
#      pins the check to it
#   e) rulesets `test-integration`, `main-owner-only` and `main-checks` on
#      marvinamiranda/.github itself first, then on each repo, created or
#      updated by name (DELIVERY §9, §10); legacy rulesets on test or main are
#      set to enforcement `disabled` (never deleted). They need the Reviewer
#      App's id: without it the run stops before it changes anything. Skipped
#      with --no-rulesets. With --self-only, d) and e) for this repository are
#      all that runs.
#   f) with --project: the Project, its Status/Priority/Size fields, and a link
#      to each repo
#
# What it never does: delete a label, a ruleset, a field, a field option or an
# issue. Anything that exists and is not in the standard is REPORTED so the
# owner can retire it deliberately. Identities are GitHub Apps, created and
# installed by the owner (governance/identity/, DELIVERY Appendix A).
#
# Needs: gh (for --apply, the owner's fine-grained token above), git, jq, and
# bash 3.2 or later.

Options:
  --repo <name>            Repository in $ORG to configure. Repeatable. Required,
                           except with --self-only.
  --self-only              Only $ORG/$SELF_REPO's own rulesets (with --probe, its
                           probe too); takes no --repo. The first run, once this
                           repository's own pull request has merged.
  --apply                  Execute the changes. Without it nothing is written.
  --no-rulesets            Everything except rulesets. Like every step for a product
                           repository it runs after that repository's adoption pull
                           request has merged, since it reads its .github/governance/
                           from $CONFIG_REF. The rulesets follow in a run without it.
  --probe                  Have the Reviewer App post a neutral review/independent
                           check on each repo's test head (needs its key). Pair it
                           with --no-rulesets, or the same run applies the rulesets.
  --project                Also ensure the Project and link the repos to it.
  --project-title <t>      Project title. Required with --project.
  --reviewer-app-id <id>   The Reviewer App's id, which review/independent is pinned to.
                           Default: "id" in $REVIEWER_APP_JSON.
  --config-dir <dir>       Read <dir>/<repo>/areas.txt etc. instead of the repo's
                           .github/governance/ on $CONFIG_REF (local testing).
  --strict-up-to-date      Require branches to be up to date with the base before merge.
  -h, --help               This text.
