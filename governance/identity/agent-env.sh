#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Install, or refresh, an agent identity, and print its environment for `eval`
# (DELIVERY Appendix A). From a checkout of a merged commit, by the script's
# absolute path, and never without `|| echo false`: a bare `eval "$(...)"` of a
# script that is not there evaluates nothing, succeeds, and whatever follows
# runs as the owner:
#
#   eval "$(<checkout>/governance/identity/agent-env.sh mm-agent || echo false)" && gh auth status
#
# THE PER-COMMAND FORM, which must open every tool command in Claude Code and
# Codex, sources the env file that eval installed, joined with && (never ;):
#
#   . ~/.config/mm-agent/mm-agent/env && gh pr create ...
#
# A missing env file fails the `.`, and so stops the command; an env file whose
# shim is gone fails the same way. Only an eval from a commit on
# marvinamiranda/.github test writes the env file, so it only ever runs merged
# code; an eval from anywhere else sets up its own shell and leaves it alone.
#
# Both CLIs rebuild each tool command's shell from a snapshot they took when
# the session began, and a snapshot taken from the owner's environment carries
# it: Claude Code's re-applies the PATH it captured, which puts the real gh
# first; Codex's re-exports every variable it captured, which on the owner's
# machine includes their gh login token as GH_PACKAGES_TOKEN (from ~/.zshrc).
# That is the residual: a tool command that does not open with the env file
# runs as its snapshot has it; an alias named gh in the snapshot is expanded
# when the command line is parsed, before the env file can remove it (`command
# gh` sidesteps one); and the snapshot files keep whatever was exported when
# they were taken.
#
# Everything it prints is exported, so whatever a command starts inherits it:
# scripts, `bash -c`, and zsh, login or interactive. It sets:
#   PATH            the identity's gh first: ~/.config/mm-agent/<name>/shim/
#                   <commit>/bin/gh, a launcher for COPIES of gh-shim.sh and
#                   app-token.sh taken from a commit (below).
#                   Every gh call gets a token minted for it, and fails rather
#                   than fall back when none can be minted. The shim refuses
#                   `gh auth` (bar a plain `gh auth status`) and any flag ahead
#                   of the command, so no command hands out a raw token.
#   ZDOTDIR         zsh startup files of the identity's that source the owner's
#                   own (~/.zshenv, ~/.zprofile, ~/.zshrc, ~/.zlogin), then put
#                   the shim first again and these variables back. The owner's
#                   ~/.zprofile runs `brew shellenv`, which would otherwise put
#                   the real gh first in every login zsh. The owner's files are
#                   read, never edited.
#   GH_TOKEN        a sentinel, not a token; the shim replaces it on every call.
#                   A real gh reached some other way, such as a PATH that puts
#                   it first, answers `gh auth token` with the sentinel instead
#                   of the keyring login, and GitHub refuses the sentinel.
#   GITHUB_TOKEN    unset: nothing inherited from the owner's shell survives.
#   GH_PACKAGES_TOKEN  read from ~/.config/mm-agent/packages-token, which the
#                   owner creates (a classic token, read:packages only, mode
#                   0600), because GitHub Packages takes no App token. Unset,
#                   with a one-line hint, when that file is missing, open to
#                   anyone else, or holds anything but one classic token.
#   GH_CONFIG_DIR   an EMPTY directory of this identity's, so the real gh finds
#                   no stored login.
#   git identity    author and committer are the App's bot user.
#   git credentials for github.com: the helper list is reset, then one helper
#                   mints a token for each operation, and tells git to stop
#                   (quit=true) instead of trying another credential or
#                   prompting when it cannot.
#
# The copies are what every gh and git call runs, so they come from a commit,
# never a working tree: it refuses a checkout whose three identity scripts
# differ from its HEAD commit (a change hidden from `git status` included), and
# warns when that commit is not on marvinamiranda/.github test. Each commit gets
# its own directory. Which one a shell runs depends on the form:
#   the eval    installs what the checkout's HEAD is at that moment and switches
#               that shell to it; the shell keeps it when the checkout changes
#               or goes away, until it evaluates again.
#   the env file  runs the commit it names: the last one an eval from a commit
#               on test installed on this machine. The checkout can change or
#               go away without touching it.
#
# If anything fails once it is running, it prints an environment with NO
# GitHub identity rather than nothing, since `eval ""` would leave the shell on
# the owner's login: the sentinel, a gh that refuses everything (kept first in
# zsh the same way), git told to quit, no commit identity, and a status that
# makes the eval fail. A script that cannot run at all prints nothing, which
# is what `|| echo false` is for. A failed run leaves the env file as it was.
#
# This is a strong default, not a sandbox. Agents run on the owner's machine,
# under the owner's user, and the owner's keyring login is one absolute path
# away (`/opt/homebrew/bin/gh auth token --user <owner>`). The rulesets are the
# backstop (DELIVERY §9).
